    <h2>A message from the founder</h2>
    <p>
      Berry is live, stable, and moving forward. If you’ve seen the situation on X —
      yes, we’re dealing with it. No, it doesn’t affect Berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to personally apologise for any temporary disruption or slower-than-usual
      updates. I’m currently navigating an external account-access issue with a UK
      fintech provider — the kind of situation that reminds you exactly why platforms
      like Berry need to exist in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I handle that, the platform, the mission, and the build continue exactly
      as planned. Berry’s architecture, modules, and forensic engines are unaffected.

  {/* Why Berry Exists */}
  <section style={{ padding: "2rem", maxWidth: "800px", margin: "0 auto" }}>
    <h2>Why Berry Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Berry was created to solve a problem that shouldn’t exist in crypto: a lack of
      transparency, accountability, and user-first design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too many platforms hide behind closed systems, single-channel support, and
      opaque processes. When something goes wrong, users are left stranded — unable
      to access their data, their funds, or even a human being who can help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berry exists to be the opposite of that. We’re building a platform where data
      is forensic, support is multi-channel, systems are modular and auditable, and
      users stay in control of their own information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berry isn’t just another crypto tool. It’s a platform designed from day one to
      be trustworthy, inspectable, and built for real people — not just developers.
