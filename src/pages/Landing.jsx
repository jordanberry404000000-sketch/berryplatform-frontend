        <p>
          Berry is live, stable, and moving forward. If you’ve seen the situation on X —
          yes, we’re dealing with it. No, it doesn’t affect Berry, Berry AI, or any of the
          forensic engines that power the platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to personally apologise for any temporary disruption or slower‑than‑usual
          updates. I’m currently navigating an external account‑access issue with a UK
          fintech provider — the exact kind of situation that proves why platforms like
          Berry need to exist in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I handle that, the mission continues exactly as planned. Berry’s architecture,
          modules, and forensic systems remain unaffected and continue to operate as designed.
        </p>

      {/* Why Berry Exists */}
      <section style={{ padding: "2rem", maxWidth: "800px", margin: "0 auto" }}>
        <h2 style={{ fontSize: "1.8rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Why Berry Exists</h2>

        <p>
          Berry was created to solve a problem that shouldn’t exist in crypto: a lack of
          transparency, accountability, and user‑first design. Too many platforms hide
          behind closed systems, single‑channel support, and opaque processes.
        </p>

        <p>
          When something goes wrong, users are left stranded — unable to access their data,
          their funds, or even a human being who can help. Berry exists to be the opposite
          of that.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’re building a platform where data is forensic, support is multi‑channel,
          systems are modular and auditable, and users stay in control of their own
          information.
        </p>

        <p>
          Berry isn’t just another crypto tool. It’s a platform designed from day one to be
          trustworthy, inspectable, and built for real people. Berry AI extends that mission
          with intelligent, transparent, user‑controlled automation — never black‑box logic.
